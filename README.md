# Auto email

Sending the same e-mail (or slightly different using f-strings) to every e-mail adress in a database with Python.

The code provided works for a Gmail user. Change SMTP_SERVER to another value if you don't use Gmail.

Be aware that you can only send 1000 e-mails a day using the smtp servers.
